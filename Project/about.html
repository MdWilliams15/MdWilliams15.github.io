        <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Background</h2> 
        <p>My name is Marquesa Williams. I was born on May 7th, 2005, in Greensboro, North Carolina. Growing up in this vibrant community has shaped my outlook on life and fueled my passions. I have a strong love for video games, immersing myself in different worlds and connecting with friends through multiplayer experiences. Soccer is another significant part of my life; I appreciate the teamwork, strategy, and fitness it brings. Technology fascinates me—it's a field I’m eager to dive deeper into. Whether it’s coding, gaming technology, or the latest gadgets, I’m always looking for ways to learn and explore. My goal is to blend my interests in gaming and technology, perhaps even pursuing a career that allows me to innovate and create in those areas. I’m excited about the future and the possibilities it holds!</p>
